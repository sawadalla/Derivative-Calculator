# Derivative-Calculator
This project includes a derivative calculator GUI. 

Java Foundations (3rd Edition) by John Lewis
>“A GUI makes use of graphical screen components such as windows, buttons, check boxes, menus, and text fields” (Lewis, 245). 

GUIs often provide a more natural and rich experience for the user than a simple text-based, command line environment.

This folder contains two Java classes and two JAR files. To learn how to import you JAR files, watch the attached video file

The end result should look like this:
![derivative calculator](https://scontent.fphx1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/12308077_1082228885150706_4181109040948255189_o.jpg?oh=f211ebacaa2ab9c7de98380294361ce4&oe=59D2BAC9)
*FYI, the other regular calculator is not included in this folder.*

Of course, you can remove the checkbox, which gives access to the user to use the calculator.
